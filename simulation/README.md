## Simulation Runner

This module represents the simulation stage of the assignment.

The intended functionality includes:
- Launching Gazebo or CoppeliaSim
- Loading a 6-DOF robotic arm (UR5 / Franka)
- Creating a simple scene with a cube and target position
- Running validated ROS nodes
- Collecting logs and simulation previews

The current implementation is a stub to demonstrate the execution flow.
Full simulation integration will be completed once the simulator environment
is configured.
